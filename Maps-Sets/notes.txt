Data structure:
  A way to structure data to make it more usable within our programs. 

Ones we've seen:
  String
  Number
  Boolean
  Array
  Object

Ones some of us have heard of:
  Trees
  Maps


Maps:
  A data structure that stores data in key : value pairs. In javascript, these are easily modeled with objects.

  Items within this type of collection
    key: The identifer for a value within the collection
    value: What is being stored with the key

  {
    key: 'Hello',
    key2: 'World'
  }

Common operations for a map:
  Add/Insert - Associates a key/value pair to the collection
  Reassign - Replace the value in an existing key/value pair. 
  Remove/Delete - Removes(disassociates) a key/value pair from the collection. 
  Lookup - Finds a value associated with a key. 

Note on using objects as maps:
  In general computer science theory a map can have any other type of data structure as keys - In javascript we are limited to strings and integers. 



Challenge 1:
  Note from blackboard:
    We identified 2 separate operations for our algorithm:
      If the character is not in our map already: Add it
      If the character is in the map: Increment the value associated with that key
